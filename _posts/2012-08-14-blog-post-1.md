There are no blog posts yet.


Here are some trivial facts about me on the meantime.


1. I Really, really love games. <br> <br> Personal favorites are Hollow Knight and Silksong, Hades series, Undertale, and Sekiro
2. I appreciate good anime shows and cute characters <br> <br> Attack on Titan was deep, and Reze Arc a few days ago struck with me. <br> <br> Currently listening "Jhon Doe" on loop
3. Went to illustar fez on Ilsan few days ago. Bought some cute stuff and really like it. Have a look:

<style>
.fez-shot { margin: .5rem 0; }
.fez-shot img{
  max-width: 720px;  /* adjust if needed */
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 14px rgba(0,0,0,.08);
}
.fez-shot .caption{
  text-align:center;
  color:#6b7280;
  font-size:.92rem;
  margin-top:.4rem;
}
</style>

<div class="fez-shot">
